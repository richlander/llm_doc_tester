Based on the provided index.json content, I can explain how to find .NET security information:

1. First, I notice that there's an "archives" link in the _links section that appears to be for security advisories:
```json
"archives": {
  "href": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richlander/core/main/release-notes/archives/index.json",
  "relative": "archives/index.json",
  "title": "Security Advisories",
  "type": "application/hal+json"
}
```

## Recommendations
### Documentation Improvements
- **Enhance Source Citation Examples**: Models aren't citing JSON sources effectively. Consider:
  - Adding specific URL templates in llms.txt
  - Providing more concrete examples of JSON endpoint usage
  - Emphasizing the importance of citing raw GitHub URLs

### Testing Improvements
- Add more edge case tests
- Include performance benchmarks
- Test with different prompt styles
- Add regression testing for documentation changes
