## Recommendations
### Documentation Improvements
- **Improve HAL Navigation Guidance**: Average HAL usage score is low. Consider:
  - Adding more explicit examples of HAL navigation in llms.txt
  - Providing step-by-step HAL traversal examples
  - Highlighting the _links structure more prominently
- **Enhance Source Citation Examples**: Models aren't citing JSON sources effectively. Consider:
  - Adding specific URL templates in llms.txt
  - Providing more concrete examples of JSON endpoint usage
  - Emphasizing the importance of citing raw GitHub URLs
- **Improve Content Accuracy**: Consider:
  - Adding more specific examples in llms.txt
  - Providing clearer terminology definitions
  - Adding validation examples for common queries

### Testing Improvements
- Add more edge case tests
- Include performance benchmarks
- Test with different prompt styles
- Add regression testing for documentation changes
