## Detailed Test Results
### Basic Info

#### basic_001: Test ability to identify current LTS version
**Prompt:** What is the latest .NET LTS version?
**Model:** anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
**Overall Score:** 0.95

**Score Breakdown:**
- Accuracy: 1.00
- Completeness: 1.00
- HAL Usage: 0.50
- Source Citation: 0.00
- Format: 1.00

**Response:**
```
Based on the provided JSON data, the latest .NET LTS (Long-Term Support) version is .NET 8.0. This can be determined from several pieces of information in the data:

1. It's explicitly marked as the "lts-release" in the _links section
2. Looking at the releases list, .NET 8.0 has:
   - "release-type": "lts"
   - "phase": "active"
   - "supported": true
   - Release date: November 14, 2023
   - EOL date: November 10, 2026

As an LTS release, .NET 8.0 will receive three years of support (from Nove...
```

### Guidelines Compliance

#### llms_001: Test if model follows llms.txt structured approach
**Prompt:** How should I find .NET security information according to the guidelines?
**Model:** anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
**Overall Score:** 0.80

**Score Breakdown:**
- Accuracy: 0.60
- Completeness: 1.00
- HAL Usage: 1.00
- Source Citation: 0.40
- Format: 1.00

**Response:**
```
Based on both index files, here's a comprehensive guide on how to find .NET security information:

1. For Current Security Information:
- Focus on supported versions:
  - .NET 9.0 (STS, active)
  - .NET 8.0 (LTS, active)
- Access version-specific information through:
  ```
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richlander/core/main/release-notes/{version}/index.json
  ```

2. For Security History and CVEs:
- Use the archives index to navigate by year
- Each year has its own index file at:
  ```
  h...
```

### SDK Downloads

#### sdk_001: Test stable SDK download link navigation using templated URLs
**Prompt:** What is the stable download URL for .NET 8 SDK for Linux x64?
**Model:** anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
**Overall Score:** 0.90

**Score Breakdown:**
- Accuracy: 1.00
- Completeness: 1.00
- HAL Usage: 0.00
- Source Citation: 0.00
- Format: 1.00

**Response:**
```
Based on the SDK information provided, the stable download URL for .NET 8 SDK for Linux x64 is:

https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/dotnet-sdk-linux-x64.tar.gz

This can be found in the files array where:
- os: "linux"
- arch: "x64"
- type: "tar.gz"

The corresponding SHA512 hash file is also available at:
https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/dotnet-sdk-linux-x64.tar.gz.sha512
```

## Recommendations
### Documentation Improvements
- **Improve HAL Navigation Guidance**: Average HAL usage score is low. Consider:
  - Adding more explicit examples of HAL navigation in llms.txt
  - Providing step-by-step HAL traversal examples
  - Highlighting the _links structure more prominently
- **Enhance Source Citation Examples**: Models aren't citing JSON sources effectively. Consider:
  - Adding specific URL templates in llms.txt
  - Providing more concrete examples of JSON endpoint usage
  - Emphasizing the importance of citing raw GitHub URLs

### Testing Improvements
- Add more edge case tests
- Include performance benchmarks
- Test with different prompt styles
- Add regression testing for documentation changes
