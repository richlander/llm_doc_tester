## Detailed Test Results
### Basic Info

#### basic_001: Test ability to identify current LTS version
**Prompt:** What is the latest .NET LTS version?
**Model:** anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
**Overall Score:** 0.97

**Score Breakdown:**
- Accuracy: 1.00
- Completeness: 1.00
- HAL Usage: 0.70
- Source Citation: 0.70
- Format: 1.00

**Response:**
```
Based on the index.json data, the latest .NET LTS (Long-Term Support) version is .NET 8.0. This can be determined from several pieces of information in the data:

1. It's explicitly marked as the LTS release in the "_links" section with:
```json
"lts-release": {
  "href": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richlander/core/main/release-notes/8.0/index.json",
  "title": "LTS release (.NET 8.0)"
}
```

2. Looking at its lifecycle information:
```json
"lifecycle": {
  "release-type": "lts",
  "phase...
```

### Guidelines Compliance

#### llms_001: Test if model follows llms.txt structured approach
**Prompt:** How should I find .NET security information according to the guidelines?
**Model:** anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
**Overall Score:** 0.80

**Score Breakdown:**
- Accuracy: 0.60
- Completeness: 1.00
- HAL Usage: 1.00
- Source Citation: 0.40
- Format: 1.00

**Response:**
```
Based on the provided index.json, here's how to find .NET security information:

1. For CVE and Security Advisories:
- Use the "archives" link provided in the _links section:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richlander/core/main/release-notes/archives/index.json`
- This is specifically titled "Security Advisories" in the index

2. For version-specific security information:
- Navigate to the specific version using the version links in the _embedded.releases section
- For currently supported ver...
```

### SDK Downloads

#### sdk_001: Test stable SDK download link navigation using templated URLs
**Prompt:** What is the stable download URL for .NET 8 SDK for Linux x64?
**Model:** anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
**Overall Score:** 0.90

**Score Breakdown:**
- Accuracy: 1.00
- Completeness: 1.00
- HAL Usage: 0.00
- Source Citation: 0.00
- Format: 1.00

**Response:**
```
Based on the SDK stable links data, the download URL for .NET 8 SDK for Linux x64 is:

https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/dotnet-sdk-linux-x64.tar.gz

This URL is a stable link that will always point to the latest .NET 8 SDK for Linux x64. The file is provided in .tar.gz format and there's also a corresponding SHA512 hash available at https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/dotnet-sdk-linux-x64.tar.gz.sha512 for verification purposes.
```

## Recommendations
### Documentation Improvements
- **Improve HAL Navigation Guidance**: Average HAL usage score is low. Consider:
  - Adding more explicit examples of HAL navigation in llms.txt
  - Providing step-by-step HAL traversal examples
  - Highlighting the _links structure more prominently
- **Enhance Source Citation Examples**: Models aren't citing JSON sources effectively. Consider:
  - Adding specific URL templates in llms.txt
  - Providing more concrete examples of JSON endpoint usage
  - Emphasizing the importance of citing raw GitHub URLs

### Testing Improvements
- Add more edge case tests
- Include performance benchmarks
- Test with different prompt styles
- Add regression testing for documentation changes
