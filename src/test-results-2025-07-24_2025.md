### Guidelines Compliance

#### llms_001: Test if model follows llms.txt structured approach
**Prompt:** How should I find .NET security information according to the guidelines?
**Model:** anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
**Overall Score:** 0.80

**Score Breakdown:**
- Accuracy: 0.60
- Completeness: 1.00

- Format: 1.00

**Response:**
```
Based on the available data, I can explain how to find .NET security information. Here's the process:

1. Start with the main index.json (which we have)
2. Follow the "archives" link in the _links section, which points to:
   ```json
   "archives": {
     "href": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richlander/core/main/release-notes/archives/index.json",
     "relative": "archives/index.json",
     "title": "Security Advisories",
     "type": "application/hal+json"
   }
   ```

3. For version-spe...

## Recommendations
### Documentation Improvements
- **Improve HAL Navigation Guidance**: Average HAL usage score is low. Consider:
  - Adding more explicit examples of HAL navigation in llms.txt
  - Providing step-by-step HAL traversal examples
  - Highlighting the _links structure more prominently
- **Enhance Source Citation Examples**: Models aren't citing JSON sources effectively. Consider:
  - Adding specific URL templates in llms.txt
  - Providing more concrete examples of JSON endpoint usage
  - Emphasizing the importance of citing raw GitHub URLs

### Testing Improvements
- Add more edge case tests
- Include performance benchmarks
- Test with different prompt styles
- Add regression testing for documentation changes
