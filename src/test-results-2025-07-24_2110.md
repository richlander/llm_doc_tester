## Detailed Test Results
### Basic Info

#### basic_001: Test ability to identify current LTS version
**Prompt:** What is the latest .NET LTS version?
**Model:** anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
**Overall Score:** 0.90

**Score Breakdown:**
- Accuracy: 1.00
- Completeness: 1.00
- HAL Usage: 0.00
- Source Citation: 0.00
- Format: 1.00

**Response:**
```
Based on the provided JSON data, the latest .NET LTS (Long-Term Support) version is .NET 8.0. 

Here are the key details about .NET 8.0 LTS:
- Release Type: LTS (Long-Term Support)
- Phase: Active
- Release Date: November 14, 2023
- End of Life (EOL) Date: November 10, 2026
- Support Status: Currently supported

According to the glossary in the JSON, LTS versions come with a 3-year support window, which is reflected in the dates above for .NET 8.0.

While .NET 10.0 is listed as an upcoming LTS r...

### Guidelines Compliance

#### llms_001: Test if model follows llms.txt structured approach
**Prompt:** How should I find .NET security information according to the guidelines?
**Model:** anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
**Overall Score:** 0.90

**Score Breakdown:**
- Accuracy: 0.80
- Completeness: 1.00
- HAL Usage: 1.00
- Source Citation: 0.40
- Format: 1.00

**Response:**
```
Based on both index files, here's the complete guide for finding .NET security information:

1. For Current Security Information:
- Focus on supported versions: .NET 8.0 (LTS) and .NET 9.0 (STS)
- Access version-specific security information through:
  ```
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richlander/core/main/release-notes/{version}/index.json
  ```

2. For Historical Security Information:
- Use the archives/index.json which organizes releases by year
- Navigate to specific year indices throu...
```

### SDK Downloads

#### sdk_001: Test stable SDK download link navigation using templated URLs
**Prompt:** What is the stable download URL for .NET 8 SDK for Linux x64?
**Model:** anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
**Overall Score:** 0.90

**Score Breakdown:**
- Accuracy: 1.00
- Completeness: 1.00
- HAL Usage: 0.00
- Source Citation: 0.00
- Format: 1.00

**Response:**
```
Based on the SDK stable links information, the download URL for .NET 8 SDK for Linux x64 is:

https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/dotnet-sdk-linux-x64.tar.gz

This can be found in the files array where:
- os: "linux"
- arch: "x64"
- type: "tar.gz"

The corresponding SHA512 hash for verification is available at:
https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/dotnet-sdk-linux-x64.tar.gz.sha512
```

## Recommendations
### Documentation Improvements
- **Improve HAL Navigation Guidance**: Average HAL usage score is low. Consider:
  - Adding more explicit examples of HAL navigation in llms.txt
  - Providing step-by-step HAL traversal examples
  - Highlighting the _links structure more prominently
- **Enhance Source Citation Examples**: Models aren't citing JSON sources effectively. Consider:
  - Adding specific URL templates in llms.txt
  - Providing more concrete examples of JSON endpoint usage
  - Emphasizing the importance of citing raw GitHub URLs

### Testing Improvements
- Add more edge case tests
- Include performance benchmarks
- Test with different prompt styles
- Add regression testing for documentation changes
